# Stroop_Effect
Using descriptive statistics and a statistical test, analysis of the Stroop effect is performed, a classic result of experimental psychology. Here the readers were provided with a set of words, where each word is displayed in a color. The participant's task is to say the color of the word out loud in which it is printed. There are two consitions - one being the congruent word conditions, the other being incongruent word condition. In case of congruent word condition, the words are displayed which matches the color in which they are printed in. In case of incongruent word condition, the word displayed does not match with the color they are printed in. Each participant has to go through this process in order to record the time for each condition. 
In the end, a conclusion is drawn where the readers are given a good intuition for the data and the use of statistical inference based on the results.
